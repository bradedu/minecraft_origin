Subject: [PATCH] Remove deprecation on some player lookup methods

Most of these methods still have plenty of use given that only one player with each name can exist at a time. Deprecating these methods renders even basic functionality such as /msg <name> impossible without causing compiler warnings. We will maintain this API and it should be considered safe and appropriate for most use cases.
